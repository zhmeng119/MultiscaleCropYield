# Multi-Scale Estimation of Crop Yield (基于多空间尺度的农作物产量估计)
- This project is aiming to compare the predicted maize yield results generated from data with different spatial scales, such as ground level and space level, and hopefully, the comparison can help us understand what are the factors that are affecting the predicted yield.
